# Overall impression

Good coverage of the data sets and background information. The full report covers a complex and interesting investigation into a question that is not trivial or trite. The report is written thoroughly and methodically. It is very clear to the reader the trends and patterns that exist in the data sets that are being analyzed. The report shows some weaknesses in the discussion of granular information about the data sets and interpretation of the final analysis results. Also the report could benefit from better presentation. For example, placing text discussing a figure right next to the figure would improve the quality of the report. 

# Major comments 

Some major comments from the other teams in our discussion group are as follows:

* Without an abstract, the report structure is less academic. 
* The introduction, while precise and concise is too long.
* The statistical method, procedure, and interpretation should be broken into sections to make it very clear to the reader.
* The data set for anxiety levels seems sparse and too precise, degrading the analysis that is done in the report.
* Providing context for the figures right next to the plots would improve reader legibility. The reader will not have to scroll up to view the plot if this is done.

# Minor comments 

Some minor comments from the other teams in our discussion group are as follows:

* In text citations are done inappropriately. While the references and links make it easy to find the source, APA style dictates that an author name and year are all that should be included. 
* It would be preferred if the discussion on what data sets are used were in the background section.
* A trend line for the Google trends would be helpful in visually showing the overall trend.
* Some clearer plot labels would benefit the legibility and reader comprehension. For example, the plots in the Inferential Analysis section should have better titles and x and y labels.
* Some more discussion on validating the choice to use mean over median would improve the reliability of the analysis.
* Consistency in discussing errors in the data would make the report more comprehensible. For example, the discussion of the errors in the number of deaths plot switches terms from "issue" to "error".
* The data presented is presented in different time frames throughout the report. For example, only 3 plots include data from 2021. Perhaps this should be changed so that all the time frames are the same.

# Questions to address during the final presentation

1. What are some possible reasons case counts are correlated with higher anxiety rates but not deaths?
2. What are some possible confounders?
3. What are the symptoms/indicators of anxiety and depression and is there a level of severity being measured?
4. Does an association exists between the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the frequency of indicators, or symptoms, of depressive or anxiety disorder?
5. What improvements in the model resulted due to the log transformation of the case data?
